        Beewar is a turn based strategy game where players can move pieces and attack other pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have heard of Weewar, and may be a fan of it. Yes! This game is similar to Weewar, even down to the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, why did I pick this name?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are several reasons I can think of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>It is similar in name to Weewar.</li>
        <li>I like to eat at jollibee (even though I've only been there once).</li>
        <li>I practice competitive programming, and my club happens to like bees. <a href="https://jollybee.binus.ac.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's</a> a link to my club's website.</li>
        <li>On the off chance I want to animefy this game, because I like anime,
          I can totally <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anime+bee+girl&safe=strict&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJn62Rt8HuAhVDfH0KHeCjB4sQ_AUoAXoECA4QAw&biw=1728&bih=1018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do</a> it.
          There's even another intense game on steam with the same name. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
      </ol>
