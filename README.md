# BeeWar FE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And it's not yet ejected. Don't eject pls

## Quickstart

Get npm

```text
// install deps
npm install
// start server
npm start
```

To lint before commit

```text
npm run lint
```

You can see `package.json` to see other commands too (in the scripts section), but don't eject pls.

## deploy to gitlab pages

There is `gitlab-ci.yml`, read it.
It is set to run a pipeline to deploy to gitlab pages, but only in master branch
So, you don't really have to do anything, really.
